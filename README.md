### Project description 

The bank is asking for help: it wants to develop a loyalty campaign to retain customers, but for this it needs to find out the main reasons for the outflow of customers. In other words, it is necessary to establish how the departed customers differ from the loyal ones and how the various signs that define customers are related to each other.

After an intelligence analysis, in order to identify the most important signs of outflow, the bank will be able to build a machine learning model that will predict the client's departure.

### Bank questionnaire

1. What is the ratio of left and loyal customers? Show it on the graph and give a comment on the ratio.

2. Create a graph showing the balance distribution of users who have more than $2,500 in their account. 

3. Look at the distribution of the client's balance in the context of the outflow feature. How do the amounts on the savings account of left and loyal customers differ? 

4. Look at the distribution of age in the context of the outflow feature. What age category of customers should the bank pay attention to?

5. Create a graph that shows the relationship between the client's credit rating and his estimated salary. Add a coloring based on customer churn. What is the relationship between the features?

6. Who leaves more often, men or women?

7. How does the outflow of customers depend on the number of services purchased from the bank?

8. How does the presence of an active client status affect the outflow of clients? 

9. In which country is the share of departed customers greater? Create a heat cartogram that will show this ratio on the world map. 

10. Make a summary table, the rows of which are the categories of credit rating (CreditScoreCat), and the columns are the number of years during which the client uses the bank's services (Tenure). The cells of the pivot table should contain the proportion of users who have left.
Based on the resulting summary table, build a heat map with an annotation. Find on the heat map the categories of customers who leave most often.
